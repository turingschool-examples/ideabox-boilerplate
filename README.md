# Ideabox Group Project

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." In this project, we'll be building an application that records and archives our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we'll rely on JavaScript to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and `localStorage` to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

## Learning Goals

* Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
* Understand how to implement client-side data persistence using `localStorage`
* Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
* Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

### Wins + Challenges:

#### Wins
- We were able to deepen our understanding of the connection between the Data Model and the DOM. We also now understand the importance of updating the DOM directly based upon the Data Model.
- We progressed in working collaboratively as a team. We were able to see the value by gaining new understanding from teammates and their ways of thinking.
- We successfully navigated working collaboratively with multiple people's schedules by remaining flexible and adaptable.

#### Challenges:
- We originally had a tough time getting the the display to update along with the data model. We ened up using "hidden" as filter with ".add" and ".remove"
- Another challenge was figuring out how to set up the filtering system. We originally had to repeat the innerHTML, but created a new function to simplfy it.
